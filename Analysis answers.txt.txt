Train size = 623 rows
Test size = 268 rows
Final Train accuracy (5 layers) = 85.23%
Final Test accuracy (5 layers) = 80.22%


What happened when you increase the number of layers?
Answer: Increasing layers improved test accuracy but also increased execution time. The accuracy was best at 4 layers, after that accuracy starts reducing.

What happened when you increase the number of neurons and layers both?
Answer: Increasing both improved accuracy by around 5% but increased training duration.

What is the number of layers and neurons in each layer of your final model?
Answer: Final model: 5 layers with 64 neurons each (hidden layers) and 1 neuron in the output layer.

After how many epochs did your model stop improving?
Answer: The model stopped improving significantly after 70 epochs.

What is batch size? Did you change batch size in your training?
Answer: Batch size is the number of samples processed before updating model parameters. Used 32 initially, then 64, reducing training time without loss of accuracy.
